Data Insights

1) Capomulin treatment is highly promising, as it had the second lowest mean and median tumor volume. It also had a standard deviation of 4.99, which was the second lowest, indicating that the values are clustered close to the mean. Although Ramicane provided lower tumor values, the difference was very slight and requires further analysis between the two drugs to determine if Ramicane is significantly more effective at reducing tumor volume than our test drug.

2) Mouse l509 seems to have experienced some mixed results from Capomulin. As the course of treatment progressed until about the halfway timepoint, the mouse's tumor volume consistently increased. After day 20, we begin to see a downward trend in tumor volume with a one slight increase at day 30, which is then followed by a large decrease. However, we then begin to see another spike at day 40. It would be interesting to observe this mouse's tumor trend to see if there are increases, but it may also be a waste of time since it is possible that this mouse is an outlier and not reflective of the sample as a whole.

3) The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84. Since this value is close to 1, there is a strong positive relationship between the two variables. As average tumor volume increases, mouse weight increases. This makes sense, as an increase in volume would add more weight to the mouse.
